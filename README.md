`bluefly` is a one-shot [Vagrant][vagrant-url] engine for bootstrapping batteries-included development environments.

[vagrant-url]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant

`bluefly` is entirely built and maintained by [@refcell](https://github.com/refcell).
Design and architecture decisions are opinionated.
Suggestions, issues, and prs will be heavily considered since `bluefly` acts as a development bedrock. 

*Bluefly would not be possible without the preceeding [lunarvim][lvim-url] and [astronvim][astronvim-url] projects.*
